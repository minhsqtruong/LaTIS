# Latency, Througput Instruction Set (LaTIS) Benchmark for x86
This project provides a simple interface to benchmark/add new benchmark suite for x86 instruction set.
It gives programmers rough estimate of latency and throughput of a particular machine that can be helpful
to develop optimzed kernel for high performance computing.
